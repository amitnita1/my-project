1-At first I created dataBase for both Donor and DonorCamp

2-After that connected both  to the Eureka server

3-And then I have  checked and found Controllers Methods are working perfectly in PostMan 

4-After this Added Actuators

5-And now Implemented Spring MVC and all the methods are working 





Methods which are not working properly-

1-Clients can view donors of Specific Group who are eligible to donate, eligible donor are those who have donated blood six months before the current date 

2-Update method I have implemented but this, after adding some code Im getting error which Im unable to figure out.
